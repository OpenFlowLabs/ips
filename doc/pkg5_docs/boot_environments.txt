As of 2010/03, we always create new boot environments
when doing an image-update, and never do so for
install, instead failing the operation should an action
tagged w/ reboot-needed be affected.  We also always 
create new boot environments for change-variant and
change-facet operations, and never for fix.

This needs work.

Instead, I'd like to propose the following:

1) We support the creation of a new optional backup
boot environment before executing the operation
on the live image.  Non-live images can easily
use snapshots for this; this option would have
no effect in the case that the operation creates
a new BE.

2) All image-modifying operations on a live image
would create a new boot environment only if needed.
This behavior could be altered via command line flags
to always create a new boot environment or to never 
create one, failing instead if the operation needs
one.

pkg install 
pkg fix 
would both get the following new options:

[--backup-be]
[--backup-be-name name]
[--no-new-be | --always-new-be]
[--be-name name]

pkg image-update
pkg change-facet
pkg change-variant

would all get the following new options:

[--backup-be]
[--backup-be-name name]
[--no-new-be | --always-new-be]

So, to retain the current behavior,

invoke pkg install --no-new-be ....

invoke pkg image-update --always-new-be ...
       pkg change-facet --always-nes-be ...
       pkg change-variant --always-new-be ...
