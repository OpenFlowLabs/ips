TODO

  During the prototype phase, this is merely a list of items not fully
  discussed, written up or implemented.

1.  Algorithms/Logic

	- Preferred publisher fallback
		- a discussion of catalogs, comparisons between, and
		  operations on
		- per-package publisher association

	- Catalog update mechanism
		- event oriented
		- digested

	- Freeze/constraint flow
		- statement
		- back tracking

	- Snapshot/revert safety

	- Image/substrate relationship
	- Image operational history

	- Conventions for automated repository discovery
	- Peer/neighborhood cooperation/verification/etc.

	- Depot management
		- store forever and demote from catalog
		- conserve disk space
		- client as depot?

	- Compatibility options
		- understand SysV as fixed version:timestamp packages
		  from a legacy publisher?

2.  Formats/interfaces

	- Versioned formats (event, full) for catalog
	- Versioned format for manifest

	- Versioned format for marshalled transactions ("new package
	  format")

	- Practices around REST and versions (entry points or data?)

3.  Data analysis

	- continued examination of version and patch history of S9 and
	  S10 (S8?)
		- write up worked examples (e.g. telnet on both sides
		  of private kernel API change)

4.  Coding

	- Server split to transaction server and plain old HTTP server
	  sides

	- SSH tunnel support in pkgsend(1)
