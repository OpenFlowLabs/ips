How IPS Features Are Used when Packaging the OpenIndiana OS
..............................................................

This chapter describes how IPS is used to package OpenIndiana, and how
the various dependency types are used to define working package sets for the OS.

We include this chapter to give another concrete example of how IPS can be used
to manage a complex set of software, and talk about some of the IPS features
that were used.

Versioning
~~~~~~~~~~

In *Chapter 3* we discussed the ``pkg.fmri`` attribute, and talked about the
different components of the version field, describing how the version field can
be used to support different models of software development.

This section explains how OpenIndiana uses the version field, and is provided
to give an insight into the reasons why a fine-grained versioning scheme can be
useful.  Developers **do not** have to follow the same versioning scheme as
OpenIndiana.

Given a sample package::

    pkg://openindiana.org/system/library@0.5.11,5.11-2018.0.0.18233:20190417T022656Z

This is how the version field ``0.5.11,5.11-2018.0.0.18233:20190417T022656Z``
is broken down:

    0.5.11
        The component version.  For packages that are provided by illumos-gate,
        this is the OS major.minor version.  For packages developed outside,
        this is the upstream version. For example, the Apache Web Server in the
        package:

        ``pkg:/web/server/apache-24@2.4.39,5.11-2018.0.0.0:20190406T083404Z``

        has the component version 2.4.39.

    5.11
        This is the build version.  This is used to define the OS release that
        this package was built for and should always be 5.11 for packages created
        for OpenIndiana.

    2018.0.0.18233
        This is the branch version. OpenIndiana uses the following notation
        for the branch version in this release:

            * 2018: Major release number. Usually corresponds to the current year
            * 0: Release minor number. Can be incremented on significant updates.
            * 0: Update number. Usually incremented when a lot of components need rebuilding.
            * 18233: Component revision, incremented for each component update.
              In this case it refers to illumos-gate commit number.

    20190417T022656Z
        This is the timestamp, defined when the package was published.


Incorporations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenIndiana is delivered by a set of packages, with each group of packages
constrained by an incorporation.

Each incorporation roughly represents the organization that developed each
group of packages, though there are some cross-incorporation dependencies
within the packages themselves.  The following is a list of the incorporation
packages in OpenIndiana:

    * ``pkg:/consolidation/cde/cde-incorporation``
    * ``pkg:/consolidation/dbtg/dbtg-incorporation``
    * ``pkg:/consolidation/install/install-incorporation``
    * ``pkg:/consolidation/jdmk/jdmk-incorporation``
    * ``pkg:/consolidation/man/man-incorporation``
    * ``pkg:/consolidation/nspg/nspg-incorporation``
    * ``pkg:/consolidation/osnet/osnet-incorporation``
    * ``pkg:/consolidation/userland/userland-incorporation``
    * ``pkg:/consolidation/X/X-incorporation``

Each of these incorporations includes:

    * general package metadata
    * ``incorporate`` dependencies, sometimes with ``variant.arch`` variants
      to denote dependencies that are specific to a given architecture
    * a ``license`` action that ensures that when the incorporation is
      installed, a license is displayed

Each of the packages delivered on the system contains a ``require`` dependency
on one of these incorporations.

OpenIndiana also includes a special package called ``entire``.

The ``entire`` constrains dependency on userland-incorporation.


facet.version-lock.*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some of the incorporations, listed above use ``facet.version-lock.*`` facets,
which were discussed in *Chapter 6*.

For example, looking at the ``pkg:/consolidation/userland/userland-incorporation``
package, we see::

    .
    .
    depend type=incorporate \
        fmri=library/python/subversion@1.9.7-2018.0.0.1 \
        depend facet.version-lock.library/python/subversion=true
    depend type=incorporate \
        fmri=library/security/libassuan@2.1.3-2018.0.0.1 \
        facet.version-lock.library/security/libassuan=true
    depend type=incorporate \
        fmri=network/chat/ircii@0.2011.11.15-2018.0.0.1 \
        facet.version-lock.network/chat/ircii=true
    .
    .
    etc.

enabling the administrator to allow certain packages to float free from the
constraints of the incorporation package.

Notably, the ``entire`` package also contains version-lock facet, allowing
userland incorporation to be removed.  However, this can result in a system
which is difficult to fix, and this package should only be unlocked
on development systems.

Informational attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following attributes are not necessary for correct package installation,
but having a shared convention lowers confusion between publishers and
users.

    info.classification
       See *Chapter 3* under "Set actions", and *Appendix A*.

    info.keyword
       A list of additional terms that should cause this package to be
       returned by a search.

    info.maintainer
       A human readable string describing the entity providing the
       package.  For an individual, this string is expected to be their
       name, or name and email.

    info.maintainer-url
       A URL associated with the entity providing the package.

    info.upstream
       A human readable string describing the entity that creates the
       software.  For an individual, this string is expected to be
       their name, or name and email.

    info.upstream-url
       A URL associated with the entity that creates the
       software delivered within the package.

    info.source-url
       A URL to the source code bundle, if appropriate, for the package.

    info.repository-url
       A URL to the source code repository, if appropriate, for the
       package.

    info.repository-changeset
       A changeset ID for the version of the source code contained in
       info.repository-url.

OpenIndiana Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    org.opensolaris.arc-caseid
        One or more case identifiers (e.g., PSARC/2008/190) associated with
        the ARC case (Architecture Review Committee) or cases associated with the
        component delivered by the package.

    org.opensolaris.smf.fmri
        One or more FMRIs representing SMF services delivered by this
        package.   These attributes are automatically generated by |pkgdepend|
        for packages containing SMF service manifests.

OpenIndiana Tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    variant.opensolaris.zone
        See *Chapter 12*

Organization Specific Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Organizations wanting to provide a package with additional metadata
    or to amend an existing package's metadata (in a repository that
    they have control over) must use an organization-specific prefix.
    For example, a service organization might introduce
    ``service.example.com,support-level`` or
    ``com.example.service,support-level`` to describe a level of support
    for a package and its contents.
