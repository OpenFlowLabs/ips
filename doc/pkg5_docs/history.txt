HISTORY

1. Summary

The intent of history is to enable pkg clients to maintain a record of all
image-modifying operations that they perform.

2. Discussion

2.1 Operations

    The following operations are currently recorded by the clients that are
    part of pkg(5):

        add-publisher
        image-create
        image-set-attributes
        image-update
        install
        purge-history
        rebuild-index
        refresh-publisher
        remove-publisher
        set-publisher
        set-preferred-publisher
        uninstall
        update-publisher

    These operations were chosen because they have the potential to alter the
    behavior of pkg(5) operations or because they modify an image.

3. History Entries

3.1 Information Recorded

    Each history entry contains a record of basic information about the client
    performing the operation, along with a mix of required and optional
    information about the operation performed.

    The following information about the client is always recorded:

        client_name     - The name of the client performing the operation
                          (e.g. pkg, packagemanager)

        client_version  - The value of pkg.VERSION at the time the client
                          performed the operation (e.g. 2e5300c4f0a4+)

        client_args     - The command-line arguments used when executing the
                          client (e.g. /usr/bin/pkg install foo)

    The following information about the operation performed is always recorded:

        operation_name  - The name of the operation performed (refer to 2.1)

        start_time      - When the operation started (e.g. 20080916T214726Z)

        end_time        - When the operation ended (e.g. 20080916T214800Z)

        userid          - The id of the user that performed the operation
                          (e.g. 0)

        username        - The username of the user that performed the operation
                          (e.g. root)

        result          - The outcome of the operation and the reason for it
                          (e.g. Failed, Transport) This maps to the pkg history
                          output columns of 'outcome' and 'reason'.

    The following information about the operation will be recorded if provided
    by the client or api:

        start_state     - Information about the operation requested before any
                          evaluation of that request is performed (e.g. an
                          image plan before evaluation)

        end_state       - Information about the operation requested after
                          evaluation of that request has been performed (e.g.
                          image plan after evaluation)

        errors          - Any errors that were encountered while performing the
                          operation (i.e. tracebacks, exceptions, etc.)

        be              - The name of the boot environment on which the
                          operation was performed

        be_uuid         - The uuid corresponding to the boot environment

        new_be          - The name of any new boot environment that was created
                          while performing the operation.

        new_be_uuid     - The uuid corresponding to the new boot environment

        snapshot        - The name of the snapshot that was taken as a result of
                          this operation.  If the operation completed
                          successfully and the snapshot was destroyed, this
                          this information is not stored.

3.2 Storage

    Each history entry is recorded in a XML file located in the metadata
    directory of an image (e.g. /var/pkg) in a directory named "history".
    Each XML file is named after the pattern %Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ-sequence.xml.
    Where sequence is a numeric value appended so that when multiple
    operations are performed on an image within the same second (e.g. -02,
    -03, etc.) entries are still written correctly.

3.3 File Format

    It should be noted that this format description is that of a private
    interface and is subject to change.

    History entries are recorded in a XML file with a fairly simplistic
    structure.  The format is as follows:

        The first line of each file is a standard xml header along with the
        encoding used to save the information.  This allows the pkg history
        command to correctly display this information if the client changes
        locales later.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ascii"?>

        The second element of every history XML file is a root element used to
        contain the client and operation information.  Only one per file ever
        occurs.

        <history>

            The client element has a name and version attribute used to record
            client_name and client_version.  Only one per file ever occurs.

            <client name="pkg" version="2e5300c4f0a4+">

                The args element contains one or more "arg" (argument) elements
                that match each element of the system argument list used to
                execute the client.  It has no attributes.  Only one per file
                ever occurs.

                <args>

                    Each arg element contains a CDATA element to encapsulate
                    the raw information for the argument.  It has no attributes.

                    <arg>
                        <![CDATA[/usr/bin/pkg]]>
                    </arg>
                    <arg>
                        <![CDATA[-R]]>
                    </arg>
                    <arg>
                        <![CDATA[/tmp/test-image]]>
                    </arg>
                    <arg>
                        <![CDATA[install]]>
                    </arg>

                        <![CDATA[SUNWvim]]>
                    </arg>
                </args>
            </client>

            The operation element has the following attributes: name,
            start_time, end_time, userid, and username.  Optional attributes
            are be, snapshot and new_be, indicating the boot environment the
            operation was applied to, the snapshot taken during this operation,
            and any new boot environment created as a result.
            It can also contain the following, optional elements: start_state,
            end_state, and errors.  It only occurs once per file.

            <operation end_time="20080912T225513Z" name="install" result="Succeeded"
                start_time="20080912T225327Z" userid="101" be="solaris" username="username">

                The start_state element is used to store information about the
                operation performed before a request is evaluated (e.g. image
                plan before evaluation).  It always contains a CDATA element with
                the related information and only occurs once per file.  It has no
                attributes.

                <start_state>
                    <![CDATA[UNEVALUATED:

                    ]]>
                </start_state>

                The end_state element is used to store information about the
                operation performed after a request is evaluated (e.g. image
                plan after evaluation).  It always contains a CDATA element with
                the related information and only occurs once per file.  It has no
                attributes.

                The errors element contains one or more "error" elements
                that encapsulate the information about each error that was
                recorded during the operation.  It has no attributes, and
                only occurs once per file.

                <errors>

                    Each error element contains a CDATA element to encapsulate
                    the raw information about the error.  It has no attributes.
